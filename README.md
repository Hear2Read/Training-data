Audio recordings in various languages for training TTS software
For each language there are two files - a text file with the prompts/sentences read/recorded by a native speaker and a zip files with all the .wav audio files. There is a separate .wav file for each prompt. The recordings were made in a professional sound studio.
The first set of recordings to be posted is for Nepali.
